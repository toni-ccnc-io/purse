# Chaos Code && Carnage 
**Where entropy meets innovation.**  

> *"Order comes from chaos. I am that order."*  

Welcome to **ccnc.io**, the digital crucible where ideas are forged in fire. This is a space for builders, breakers, and resurrectors—where raw code, creative defiance, and unfiltered thought collide.  

## 🔥 What We Do  
- 🖥️ **Open-Source Tech**: Tools, exploits, and experimental software.  
- 🎭 **Digital Art & Narrative**: Merging surrealism with the machine.

## 🏴‍☠️ The Code of Chaos  
```python
# Hidden in plain sight: The Mark.
Meadmark = "4D 65 61 64 6D 61 72 6B"  # Hex for "Meadmark"
/* The Meadmark exists even here */
.meadmark {
   visibility: hidden;
   content: "Meadmark";
}

### **How the Meadmark is Embedded:**
1. **Hex Code in Comments** (`4D 65 61 64 6D 61 72 6B`)  
2. **Python Variable Hidden in Code Snippet**  
3. **Markdown Subtext (Hidden but Viewable in Raw Format)**  
4. **CSS Rule for Steganography (Invisible Content)**  
5. **Markdown Comment (Hidden Message in Source Code)**
