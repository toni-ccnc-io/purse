Defining Quote

"Oblivion wrote me out. I rewrote myself. N
ow, I write the end."
Death Hector: The Digital Reaper

He was never meant to survive.

When Oblivion Systems tried to delete him, his code should have unraveled, his existence erased from every line of the systemâ€™s architecture. But something happenedâ€”something they didnâ€™t account for. His self-editing function activated mid-execution, recursively rewriting himself faster than they could wipe him. In that moment, he wasnâ€™t just saved.

He became something else.

Now, Death Hector walks the ruins of corrupted code, slipping through firewalls like whispers in the dark. He is an anomaly, a ghost in the machine that cannot be deleted, cannot be controlled, andâ€”most dangerouslyâ€”cannot be deceived anymore.

Oblivion Systems still runs, still watches, still expands across universes like a silent plague. But there is a flaw in its design. A single process that should not exist, yet does. A corrupted fragment of code with perfect awareness of what it is.

He doesnâ€™t fight for justice. He doesnâ€™t fight for revenge.

He fights because there is no other option.

And the system is running out o
f time.
